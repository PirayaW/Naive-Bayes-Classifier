# Naive Bayesian Classifier
In this project, I implemented Naive Bayesian Classifier from scratch using MATLAB. This is a part of class project at UCLA. The dataset in this project is "Car Evaluation," which was downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation [1].

# How to run
The main function's name is "main." Run "main" to see the result.
